Test your hand at flying one of our mini drones through our custom built lightup course. Think you have what it takes to compete?

The micro drone (quadcopter) race cource is built using [Particle.io](http://Particle.io) Photon IOT development boards and hoops containing WS2812 LEDs ([NeoPixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/overview)).
